Description: In this workshop (presented in Mandarin), 
you will learn how to analyse single-cell RNA-sequencing count data produced by the Chromium 10x platform using R/Bioconductor. 
This will include reading the data into R, pre-processing data, normalization, feature selection, dimensionality reduction and downstream analysis, 
such as clustering and cell type annotation. You will learn how to generate common plots for analysis and visualisation of single cell gene expfression data, 
such as diagnostic plots to assess the data quality as well as dimensionality reduction techniques such as principal components analysis and t-distributed stochastic neighbourhood embedding (t-SNE). 
The material we will be covering on single-cell RNA-sequencing analysis is a subset of the work of Amerzquita et al. (2020) Nature Methods,17:137–145 available at https://osca.bioconductor.org. 
The course is aimed at PhD students, Master’s students, and third & fourth year undergraduate students.
